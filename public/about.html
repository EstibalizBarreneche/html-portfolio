<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Estibaliz Barreneche, currently learning Front-End Development.</p>
<p>
  On February 2023 I finished a Web Development course at Coderhouse, where I
  gained some knowledge about HTML, CSS, SASS, Flexbox, GRID, Bootcamp, Git,
  GitHub, Servers, and more. I am currently taking Angela Yu's The Complete 2023
  Web Development Bootcamp, where I will learn much more, like Javascript,
  MongoDB, DOM, SQL, etc.
</p>

<p>
  I am looking forward to changing my career path, since I am an Accounting
  Administrative Assistant. I enjoy developing new skills and working in groups.
  In fact, I consider it important to work with other in order to learn from
  them and share knowledge.
